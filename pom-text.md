An exceptionally luminous and nearby gamma-ray burst, GRB 221009A, was observed on the 9th of October 2022 by INTEGRAL, as well as numerous other space and ground telescopes. It was estimated (GCN #32793) that such an event only occurs once in half a millenium, and the chance of it happening in INTEGRAL lifetime was only about 3%. 
The capacity of INTEGRAL for nearly continuous all-sky monitoring ensured that it would not miss this once in a lifetime event. This capacity is also crucial for the forthcoming 04 run.

Luminous GRBs sometimes reveal a prolonged bright hard X-ray and gamma-ray afterglow, and for a previous GRB INTEGRAL detected it up to few hours after the event (see GRB 120711A, Martin-Carillo+ 2012). INTEGRAL was well prepared to search for this emission in new bright events, and owing to fast follow-up strategy recently optimized for multi-messenger transient counterpart searches, the observation of GRB 221009A started only in a few hours after the ToO request, managing to catch early bright afterglow.

The intensity of the GRB was so high, that its afterglow was detected in INTEGRAL/JEM-X for almost a week, far exceeding the previous record of a few hours. Long-lasting afterglows can also appear without prompt GRB if the source is not pointing straight to us: as it was also the case in GW170817. In the future, hard X-ray follow-ups of rapidly expanding population of GW sources will very likely find these so-called "orphan afterglows", providing new source of precise localization for distances which will be probed by the GW detectors in the coming years.



The image shows GRB 221009A lightcurve recorded by several INTEGRAL instruments. On the left - prompt emission phase as seen by SPI-ACS, showing the brightest part of the GRB and an extended tail unil few hours, seen even in an non-imaging detector. On the right - three revolutions of ISGRI and JEM-X observations of the hard X-ray afterglow. In the last point, only JEM-X yields a significant detection.
